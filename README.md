# CS137 Midterm

## Description
The midterm project was a class schedule program. The program starts by gathering information about the user and the current semester: the user name, semester start date, end date, semester name, the max number of classes per semester, etc. 

The program also features a menu with options to add courses, remove courses, print the semester schedule or quit the program. The menu persists until the user decides to quit.
